# Todos

This repo was built as I followed along with Gary Simon's Pluralsight course on Angular animations. You can read more about how to animate with Angular 5 here:

(https://angular.io/guide/animations)

If you're interested in working with dynamic components, check out a much more detailed breakdown of dynamic components here:

Animated todos with dynamic components has been fully upgraded to Angular 5. Checkout the Angular 5 update branch here: 
(https://github.com/dkemper01/todos-animated-dynamic-components/tree/angular5-update-1).

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
